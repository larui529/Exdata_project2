#project goal: to analyze the effect of PM2.5 to huamn health. 
#plot1 question: Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
#Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 
#emission from all sources for each of the years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.

#Read Data
NEI <- readRDS("./exdata-data-NEI_data/summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("./exdata-data-NEI_data/Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Aggregate by sum the total emissions by year
aggTotals <- aggregate(Emissions ~ year,NEI, sum)

png("plot1.png",width=480,height=480,units="px",bg="transparent")

barplot(
  (aggTotals$Emissions)/10^6,
  names.arg=aggTotals$year,
  xlab="Year",
  ylab="PM2.5 Emissions (10^6 Tons)",
  main="Total PM2.5 Emissions From All US Sources"
)
